                Good afternoon. Thank you very much for attending this presentation.
                I'm going to make the case for forming a working group to 
                standardize the GeoJSON format. There's much benefit for not a
                lot of additional work.

                    <h2>What is GeoJSON?</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Structured information about geospatially-bounded things (aka "features") and their properties</li>
                    <li>Using JavaScript Object Notation</li>
                    <li>Simplifies as much as possible</li>
                    </ul>

                    <aside class="notes">
                    "as much as possible, but no further."
                    
                    The simplification I'm talking about isn't
                    a XML vs JSON issue, it's an issue of geographic information
                    system architecture. There's been a trend toward complexity
                    in GIS. GeoJSON is deliberately more simple, not just a JSON
                    translation of other complex formats.

                    <h2>GeoJSON History</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Discovered on Freenode: #openlayers and #gdal, late 2006</li>
                    <li>Informal WG launched 2007-03-15</li>
                    <li>375 Messages later...</li>
                    <li>Format Specification published 2008-06-18</li>
                    <li>Informal WG moved to GitHub 2011-09-22</li>
                    <li>draft-butler-geojson-00 submitted 2014-01-08</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                    The format is coming up on its 7th birthday. Building 
                    consenus and writing it up took over a year. The informal
                    working group copied the IETF in some ways: we committed
                    ourselves to working openly and tried to put empirical
                    results before theory. We did not always suceed at the
                    latter (empiricism).

                    <h2>Where we are now</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>GeoJSON is improving data interchange</li>
                    <li>Maps abound, processes are evolving</li>
                    <li>Intense demand for improvement</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                    GeoJSON is very widely used. It has good to first class
                    support in geospatial software. In proprietary products
                    as well as in open source.

                    There's demand for improvement from GeoJSON.

                    For example, GitHub. It's a very popular site for 
                    sharing and curating GeoJSON. But because GeoJSON isn't
                    a real standard, GitHub's support is variable in quality.
                    GitHub takes IETF standards like HTTP, JSON, link headers
                    seriously, but GeoJSON less so.

                    People want GeoJSON to play a role in their infrastructures.
                    They want to build on it. They want to extend it. They
                    aren't sure how to do this. An RFC will make a huge difference
                    and a working group.

                    From the SDWWG charter:

                    "The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group must be mindful of the needs of front end Web developers, however, it will not develop any geospatial or map rendering technologies. In other words, this WG is focused specifically on the intersection of the issues facing OGC and W3C members."

                    The SDWWG is not developing any tech, which is as it should be.

                    GeoJSON standardization helps their cause. I fully expect
                    member of that WG to participate in a GeoJSON WG.

                    to use it, but are blocked by the lack of formal 
                    standardization. One of them has expressed the situation
                    as "brown-bagging GeoJSON" in their enterprise.

                    need JSON expertise to get it right.

                    I'm certain that we'll need to discuss other geometry
                    primitives such as curves.

                    Coordinate reference systems will need to be discussed.
                    The original GeoJSON specification did a poor job with
                    coordinate reference systems.

                    There are people who will help work on this but not 
                    outside a more formal WG.
